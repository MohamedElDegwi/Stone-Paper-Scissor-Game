# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game

A simple game that simulates the famous hand-game (Rock-Paper-Scissors). It is implemented using structured programming in C++.

**Note:** Some input validations may not be handled!

## Game Overview

The game starts by asking the user to specify the number of rounds he/she wish to play. After that, each round hold three possible scenarios:

1. If the computer wins, the screen turns red, and a sound of a bell ringing.
2. When the user wins, the screen turns into green.
3. In the draw, the screen turns into yellow.

After completion of all rounds, the game ends, and the results are presented. The results display the overall winner, and the screen undergoes the same dynamic color changes as experienced during the rounds.

## Restart or Go

After the end of the game, the user is asked to decide whether he/she wish to play again. If the answer is yes, the game resets, offering a fresh start. In case of "no" was the answer, the game ends.
