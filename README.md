# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game

A simple yet engaging game that simulates the famous hand-game (Rock-Paper-Scissors) with interactive features to add a touch of fun to each round. The game is implemented using structured programming in C++.

**Note:** Some input validations may not be handled!

## Game Overview

The game kicks off by prompting the user to specify the number of rounds they wish to play. Subsequently, each round unfolds with three possible scenarios:

1. If the computer emerges victorious, the screen takes on a striking red hue, accompanied by the sound of a bell ringing.
2. When the user prevails, the screen transforms into a vibrant green.
3. In the event of a draw, the screen adopts a warm yellow tone.

Upon completion of all rounds, the game concludes, and the results are presented. The results display the overall winner, and the screen undergoes the same dynamic color changes as experienced during the rounds.

## Restart or Conclude

Following this, the user is prompted to decide whether they wish to play again. If the answer is affirmative, the game resets, offering a fresh start. In case of a negative response, the game gracefully concludes.

Feel free to explore the immersive world of Stone-Paper-Scissor, where classic gameplay meets a touch of modern interactivity!
